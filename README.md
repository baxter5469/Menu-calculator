## Menu Calculator
This is one of the many Python projects I have completed in Programming Class. This program will do the following:
* Display Menu
* Ask User what item they would like to buy
* How many of that item
* Ask user if they are done ordering if not go back to step 2
* Asks if the bill will be split
* Displays Price per person or total bill
